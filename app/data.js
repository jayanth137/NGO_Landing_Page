      ' The Smile Foundation Society and the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) in Panipat collaborated to address the increasing risk of accidents due to reduced visibility caused by mud on the roads. To prevent accidents, they installed reflectors on vehicles at Panipat toll. During the event, officials highlighted that road accidents were not solely caused by the absence of reflectors but were exacerbated by foggy conditions during winters, reducing visibility and causing significant accidents. The installation of reflectors, particularly red ones at the rear, yellow on the sides, and white at the front, was emphasized as crucial for accident prevention. Officials noted the rising graph of accidents in the district and initiated a campaign to raise awareness, focusing on reducing nighttime accidents by enhancing visibility with reflectors. They also highlighted that many vehicles, particularly commercial ones, lack essential safety features like headlights, taillights, and reflectors, posing a serious risk on the roads. Advocate Sunita Siwach stressed the importance of installing retro reflective tape on vehicles like auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, carts, tipahias, and tractor trolleys to mitigate accidents caused by inadequate lighting.Panipatbar Pradhan Amit acknowledged the work of the society, pointing out the lack of reflectors and radium tape on over 60% of vehicles. He advocated for installing reflective tape on household vehicles to prevent accidents. The collaboration saw cooperation from various individuals, including Vinay Malik, Vipul, Rahul, Mukesh Sandhu Rajesh Sivach, Vikramjeet, Saroj, Jaydeep Arora, Rakhi, Vikram, and others during the initiative.',
